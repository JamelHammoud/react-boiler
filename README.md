# react-boiler

Use `yarn start` to start the development server.

## Conventions

* All components live within the `components` folder
* Each component is within a folder with the same name as the component (use CamelCase!)
* Each component folder contains at least three files:
  * index.tsx (used to export the component/styled component)
  * ComponentName.tsx (used for the actual component)
  * ComponentName.Styled.tsx (used for the styled component)
